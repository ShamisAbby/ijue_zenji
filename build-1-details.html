              <p>
                The second Sultan of Zanzibar, Barghash bin Said, had the House of Wonders built as a ceremonial palace and official 
                reception hall in 1883. It was one of six palaces built for the Sultan during this period. The building was erected 
                as a celebration of modernity; it was the first place to have electricity on the Island, and was also home to the 
                first elevator in East Africa. Indeed, even today the House of Wonders stands as the tallest building in central Stone Town. 
              </p>
              <p>
                During the 19th century, wild animals were kept in cages at the front of the building for display, and the main door 
                is said to have been made so wide as to ride an elephant through. The building is clearly one of majestic quality, 
                and its design is centred upon grandeur and lavishness.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1911 the House of Wonders was converted into government offices, and acted as the main base for the British 
                authorities. After the revolution of 1964, the new ruling Afro-ShiraS Party converted the building into a school, 
                and later a museum.

          <div class="row ">
            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
              <img src="img/details/site-1-2.jpg" alt="" class="detail-img shadow">

            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                The architecture of the palace reflected the Sultan's wealth, luxurious lifestyle and role on the Island. The building
                 has wide external verandas on all sides held up by cast iron columns, which support uniquely high ceilings and 
                 compliment the vastness of the structure. Striking features of the palace are the marble floors, a clear display of 
                 wealth, and large, decorative doors which are inscribed with phrases from the Quran.
              </p>
              <p>
                The design also includes a large covered courtyard in the centre of the building, surrounded by open galleries. 
                A new clock tower was added in 1897, and was integrated into the face of the building to replace the lighthouse 
                which had stood their originally. Building materials included coral rag, limestone and mangrove shoots
              </p>

                Interestingly, the House of Wonders is connected to the Palace Museum, which used to house the Sultan's family, 
                though secret passages about street level called 'wikios'. This served as both a convenience to the Sultan and as a 
                safety feature. It is said that the Sultan used these passages to flee the island during the Anglo-Zanzibar War in 
                1896, officially recorded as the shortest war in history; it lasted roughly 40 minutes.

            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                At present, the House of Wonders stands as a Museum of History and Culture of Zanzibar and the Swahili Coast. 
                Its heritage value remains both historic and culture, and the building is of key importance in attracting tourists 
                and acting as a major asset to the small island.
              </p>
              <p>
                The museum has been famous for the large mtepe (traditional swahili boat) exhibit which held central position in the 
                House of Wonder's inner courtyard. This boat was reconstructed in the 1990s in life-size form, at a length of 17 
                meters. The mtepe is especially unique because it is sewn and not nailed together. There are many legends about why 
                the boat was sewn, with some locals saying that there used to be a reluctance to use iron nails on the boats in case 
                they were magnetically attracted to the poles. However, it is likely that this simply proved the most efficient and 
                practical method at the time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite its magnificent design and significance in Zanzibari history, the House of Wonders has recently been in a 
                desperate state. In December 2012 a section of the House of Wonders collapsed, due to neglect and material decay. 
                It is still not yet open to the public and is currently undergoing reconstruction. Structural instability is a key, 
                specific threat to this building.
