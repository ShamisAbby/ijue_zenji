                The Palace Museum, also known as the Sultan's Palace or 'Beit al-Saheh', also stands facing the sea front on Mizingani
                 Road. It is one of the oldest buildings in Zanzibar, having been constructed in 1828, 55 years before the House of Wonders.
              </p>
              <p>
                Originally, the building was a residence for the Sultan's family, a family home as opposed to the House of Wonders 
                which was a formal, ceremonial palace. This purpose remained until the 1964 Zanzibar Revolution, when it was renamed 
                the 'People's Palace' and used as offices by the new Revolutionary Council. In 1994 it was again renamed to Palace
                Museum and was converted into a formal museum dedicated to Zanzibar's historic royalty.

                The Palace Museum is very significant architecturally, as it epitomises Zanzibar's cosmopolitan history; it is a 
                blend of European, Arabic and Indian architecture.
              </p>
              <p>
                - The building stand 3 stories high, and the walls are topped with merlons, typical of medieval architecture, giving 
                the palace a fort-like appearance.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Arches are a typical Arabic feature of the palace. 
              </p>
              <p>
                - There is an external veranda and many balconies leading out from the wide, decorative windows.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Inside remains an impressive spiralled staircase
              </p>
              <p>
                - The main entrance is framed with a large decorative Zanzibari door.

              <p>
                The physical appearance of the palace today has been mush reduced, although its structural condition remains largely 
                intact. The walls have suffered weathering and inside walls have started to erode. Recently one of the former bedrooms
                 has had to be renovated due to some structural damage and the stairway has received maintenance. 
              </p>
              <p>
                However, there have been significant efforts to restore and keep the palace as a functioning museum. Nowadays the 
                museum is home to many items of historic furniture, very old chandeliers, and decorative ebony carvings.

                Princess Salme, better known as Emily Route, a Zanzibari Princess who fled to Europe with her German husband and 
                converted to Christianity. This display has attracted many tourists and aroused much historic interest.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Palace Museum today is an important heritage site in Stone Town not only for historic reasons, but also 
                architecturally and culturally. In addition, it brings aesthetic appeal to the town's sea front.
