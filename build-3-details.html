              The Old Fort stands on Stone Town's sea front, Mizingani Road, adjacent to the House of Wonders. 
              It claims a unique place in Zanzibar's history as the old building recorded, being built in 1652.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Old Fort assumes a square plot on the sea front, with tall brown walls and fortified towers on each corner. 
              The walls enclose an inner courtyard divided into two sections. One sect contains an open-air amphitheatre with a 
              restaurant, tourist information desk and small curio shops. The other section also has similar kinds of shops, but is 
              grassed and more spatially open.

          <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
            <p>
              The fort was built by the Omanis in the 17th century to defend the Island from a Portuguese invasion, in which they were
              successful. It was built in the place of an Old Portuguese church, of which remnants can still be found, signalling in 
              the temporary end of European and Christian influence on the island.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fort was later used for a range of purposes; as prisons, barracks, and even as a depot for the construction of 
              Zanzibar's railway, which connected Stone Town to the northern village of Bububu in the early 20th century. 
              Nowadays it has been converted into a cultural centre, and a key tourist attraction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, the Old Fort has historic heritage value and cultural value today. The amphitheatre is also now used to host 
              concert and events, such as Zanzibar Film Festival and Sauti za Busara (Sounds of Wisdom music festival), giving it 
              recreational and social value as well.

          <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
            <p>
              - The amphitheatre is an impressive, character-defining feature. 
            </p>
            <p>
              - The melons on the surrounding walls are in typical Arab style.
            </p>
            <h4>Threats</h4>
            <p>
              The Old Fort's current physical condition is mixed. Inside the structure, the area is well-kept and seems to suffer 
              very few problems expect the odd case of littering. The external walls however appear to be crumbing in places, and 
              have experience weathering and material decay. There is also the problem behind the back wall of the fort with litter; 
              there are large waste heaps laying against the walls. This detracts from the aesthetic quality of the site and could be 
              a problem when the Old Fort hosts large festivals.
